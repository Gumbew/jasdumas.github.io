## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```r
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) +
     geom_point(color="dodgerblue") +
     theme_minimal() +
     labs(title = "Cars Dataset")
print(g)
```

## Directions for writing Rmd to Md files for Jekyll blogs

1. Launch RStudio, Start project in _drafts folder of your jekyll page repo
2. File > New File > R Markdown file
3. Edit yaml header to mimic jekyll with title and layout parameters and save file
    a. make sure to include the figure path in the knitr chuck options: *knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='{{ site.url }}/post_data/exploring-the-cars-dataset-')* with your desired folder outputs
4. First time only: create *r2jekyll.R* file which creates the .md file and does some house keeping about figures
5. Go to Terminal and change directory to the drafts folder `cd /Users/jasminedumas/Desktop/GitHub\ Clone\ Repos/jasdumas.github.io/_drafts/`
6. Change permission of *r2jekyll.R* file with: `chmod +x r2jekyll.R`
7. Execute `./r2jekyll.R demo.Rmd` changing the .Rmd file name
