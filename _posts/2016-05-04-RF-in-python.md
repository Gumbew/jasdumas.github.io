### What is Random Forest?

Random forests are predictive models that allow for a data driven exploration of many explanatory variables in predicting a response or target variable. Random forests provide importance scores for each explanatory variable and also allow you to evaluate any increases in correct classification with the growing of smaller and larger number of trees.

### Analysis Process

The 'Adult' dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which predicts whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data was chosen for this exercise. The dataset includes 14 variables (categorical and continuous) and 48842 observations.

The data was downloaded from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data) via excel (Data > Get External Data > From web). The column names were added and the missing values previously encoded as '?' were replaced with a blank space and saved as a csv file.

The csv file was read into R using the `readr` package and the target (y) response of <=50k or >50k was made into a binary 0, 1 response. The remaining eligible factors (categorical) were transformed into a design matrix (exploded out into 0's, 1's) with the `model.matrix()` function.

**R Code:**

```r
# data has been modified in excel initially to remove NA's as ? to '' and colnames have been added
library(readr)
adult <- read_csv("C:/Users/JD87417/Desktop/python work/Coursera/adult_income.csv")
View(adult)
adult$income_target_binary <- ifelse(adult$income_target == ">50K", 1, 0)
adult2 <- model.matrix(income_target_binary ~., data = adult)
adult2 <- as.data.frame(adult2)
dput(colnames(adult2)) # get colnames print out for python format
colnames(adult2)[98] = "income_target_50k"
write_csv(x=adult2, path="C:/Users/JD87417/Desktop/python work/Coursera/adult2_income.csv")
```

The python methodology utilized pandas, numpy, sklearn to build the Random Forest.

### Results

The explanatory variables with the highest relative importance scores were **fnlwgt, age, capital_gain, education_num, raceWhite**. The accuracy of the random forest was 85%, with the subsequent growing of multiple trees rather than a single tree, adding little to the overall accuracy of the model, and suggesting that interpretation of a single decision tree may be appropriate.
