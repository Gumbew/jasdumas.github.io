After attending the [useR! 2016 R Conference](http://user2016.org/), I felt supercharged and armed with new insights and ideas about how to further contribute to the R community. I met wonderful people in real life (IRL) from twitter and heard interesting case studies about using R for large data analysis. I already have two R packages on Github but wanted to expereince the detailed (yet rewarding) process of submitting a package to CRAN (**C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork). For my first package, I had looked to what my interests were and what was needed in the community, which turns out to be *more* analysis-ready datasets about beer. 

### Yes, BEER!

Beer analytics is the use and analysis of data to gain insight about breweries, production, operations and its impact. The U.S. Department of Treasury has a voluminous collection of historical data and reports about beer statisitcs as reported by breweries at the National level. In my previous analysis project, about [web scraping craft brewery data in Connecticiut](http://trendct.org/2016/03/18/tutorial-web-scraping-and-mapping-breweries-with-import-io-and-r/), I noticed the minimal amount of data that was available for beer-centric analyses and more interestingly the data that was publicly available on the [data.gov](data.gov) was locked in PDF's or static HTML tables. This problem presented the perfect opportunity for me to contribute a dataset package and learn more about package development.

The process for creating the R package was fairly well documented in the [R Packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham. I also looked for guidance by exaiming existing R dataset packages, like [`janeaustenr`](https://github.com/juliasilge/janeaustenr) by Julia Silge. The process to obtain the first dataset on beer materials was a horrible tale of copy and pasting 10 years worth of data from PDF format reports, but once that was was complete I was able to web scrape 8 additional datasets on the historical tax rates of beer, wine, and tobbaco products. (look for those *new* datasets on the development version 1.1.1, until I submit to CRAN in early August) 

My first submission for review, I made a silly mistake and did not upload my package to [win-builder](http://win-builder.r-project.org/) for checking the source code on a Windows machine - *I will never make that mistake again*. My reviewer, Kurt, was prompt and courteous in informing me that an error arose from a faulty site certificate in a supplied url in my documentation from [https://www.ttb.gov/beer/beer-stats.shtml](https://www.ttb.gov/beer/beer-stats.shtml). After I fixed this error, I re-submitted and was waiting by my email with schoolchild-like wonderment until my acceptance into the nearly 8000 R package community was confirmed. I'm really honored to have taken this important step from just being a consumer of R packages, to a R package developer. The R community has been really great in their feedback via Twitter:

Here is my first package available on CRAN: [`ttbbeer`](http://cran.us.r-project.org/web/packages/ttbbeer/index.html), which I will continue to update with new *"liberated"* datasets and use this as an opportunity to increase education and advocate for analysis-ready datasets on open government data portals. Here is the [wiki](https://github.com/jasdumas/ttbbeer/wiki) to follow along on the journey to more **Open Beer Data**. Cheers :beers:

To install the package type the following:

```r
install.packages("ttbbeer")
library("ttbbeer")
```

Or you can install the development version from Github:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("jasdumas/ttbbeer")
library(ttbbeer)
```
