title: Adding a Google Custom Search Engine to your beautiful-jekyll site

The author and developer of the beautiful-jekyll template, [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/2015/03/12/beautiful-jekyll-how-to-build-a-site-in-minutes/) briefly explains the details to include a Google Custom Search Engine to your blog, but I thought I would document the tasks more succinctly for others to follow.

* Navigate to [cse.google.com/cse](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) and add a new engine. (sign in if necessary)

* Add the links of your beautiful-jekyll site which end in .md (all of your markdown files you want indexed for search) in the url link boxes.

* Copy the script code which is provided after making any presentation changes in color (font, border, background, link color options are all available to customize) in the [Look and Feel section](https://cse.google.com/cse/lookandfeel/) after pressing the **"Save & Get Code"** button.

* Create a new file called **search.md** in your main repository file structure (ie username.github.io/search.md) which will be alongside your other **.md** markdown pages. Here is where you place your copied code, wrapped in a special div

```

    layout: default
    title: "Search jasdumas.github.io"
    css: "/css/search.css"
    ---
    
    ## Search username.github.io with Google!
    
    <div id="google-custom-search">
    
    // Your script goes right here between the <div></div>
    
    
    </div>
```
* Add this line to your **_config.yml**: `nav-search: search` underneath the **# List of links in the navigation bar section**

* Add this section of code to your **nav.html** file which is located in your *_includes/* folder after the *endif endfor* on line 32. (i.e. before the  `</ul> </div>` lines in the `collapse navbar-collapse` section)

```
    {% if site.nav-search %}
    		<li>
    		  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.nav-search }}" class="nav-search-link" title="Search">
    		    <span class="fa fa-search nav-search-icon"></span>
    			<span class="nav-search-text">Search</span>
    		  </a>
    		</li>
    		{% endif %}
    
```

* Add this code block to the **main.css** file in the *css* folder, right above the **/* Multi-level navigation links */** line:

```
    .nav-search-link .nav-search-icon {
      display: none;
    }
    .nav-search-link .nav-search-text {
      display: inline;
    }
    @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
      .nav-search-link .nav-search-icon {
        display: inline;
      }
      .nav-search-link .nav-search-text {
        display: none;
      }
      
    }
```

* Your should be all set with a nifty search icon on your beautiful-jekyll page which helps users navigate and find relevant content on your page!
