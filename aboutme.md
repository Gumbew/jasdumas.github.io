:briefcase: Currently working as a **Data Scientist** ([Simple](https://www.simple.com/)). Previously worked as a Associate Data Scientist ([The Hartford](https://www.thehartford.com/)), also in **R&D Engineering** roles ([Medtronic](http://www.medtronic.com/covidien), QDx) and as an **Aerospace Manufacturing Engineer** ([AdChem](http://www.acmt.aero/)).

:mortar_board: Currently on leave from the M.S. program in **Predictive Analytics** at [DePaul University](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/Current/Requirements-MS-In-Predictive-Analytics-Computational.aspx) were I was focused on **Data Science & Computational Methods**. Previously took **Computer Science graduate courses** at [Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/computer-science) school. Previously earned a Professional Certificate in **Medical Product Development** at [University of California, Irvine Extension](http://ce.uci.edu/areas/life_sciences/medical_products/). Previously earned a BSE in **Biomedical Engineering** from the [University of Hartford](http://www.hartford.edu/ceta/undergraduate/engineering/BM/). My senior research project was to develop a prototype [walk-assist](http://www.tuvie.com/wp-content/uploads/ekso-bionic-suit1.jpg) device for a T4 Paraplegic client; project nicknamed "Iron man". *I also enjoy studying topics in machine learning, data science and statistics independently through MOOCs and contributing to open source projects.* 

:floppy_disk: I like developing open source software tools to help assist others complete their data analysis work! I like programming in R & Python and interested in learning about cloud computing! 

:pencil: I enjoy technical writing and have co-authored two manuscripts, in [*Connecticut Medicine*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24156174) and [*Bioinformatics*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27503226). [My Erdos number is 6](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/paul-erdos/jasmine-dumas).

:earth_americas: I grew up in the *Lower Hudson Valley, NY* and stayed around *Connecticut* after undergrad. I'm *sometimes* available for *remote consulting* opportunities working on [**diverse** teams](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2015/08/12/the-lack-of-diversity-in-tech-is-a-cultural-issue/#7170290c3577) to solve interesting challenges with data.
