## Should I go back to school and get a Masters if I have a Bachelors? 

**Probably not**

I thought that I needed to go to grad school to increase my data science qualifications and I did, only to drop out and leave with a certificate in analytics. I worked on a lot of open source projects to enhance my resume instead of satisfying advanced education requirements. Looking back I did benefit from a few structured classes for learning how to program but a full masters/PhD is not needed to land a early career data science job.

## Should I go back to school and get a Ph.D? 

**Definetly not**

Unless the job calls for developing novel algorithms to send humans to mars ðŸš€ or creating drugs to cure cancer a Ph.D is not needed for an early career data science job at a technology company. 

## What if my background is different (i.e. not CS or Stats) from 'traditional' Data Scientists?

**Maybe, It depends if your background is quantitative**

A varied career background makes for a better data scientist. Highlight your differences in background as a postive in aiding diverse thinking on your new team. 

## How do I find and evaluate data science jobs?

When searching for jobs I look for a team that is language agnostic, has data science tooling for predictive modeling at scale, and mentorship opportunities for junior scientists.

## How do I find a data science project?

Look to your hobbies for project inspiration. I did [projects](http://jasdumas.com/projects/) in centered around bioinformatics, beer and civic open data since that is what I'm interested in.
