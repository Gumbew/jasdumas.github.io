### About Me

I’m a Data Scientist & Engineer with industry experience in financial technology, auto insurance, medical devices, R&D, and aerospace manufacturing. I'm an active member of the R programming community and have developed **4** open source R packages and participated in **Google Summer of Code, NASA Datanauts, R-Ladies, and Forwards**. 

I'm searching for a remote-friendly company that values creativity, diversity and openness as a **lead/Sr. Data Scientist** developing data products & predictive models with R & Python while mentoring junior team members.

### Technical Skills 
- Computational programming & machine learning with R and Python
- Statistical Analysis and inference
- Data processing & querying with SQL
- Web application development with Shiny and  Bootstrap
- Collaborative computing with GitHub and Git

### Featured Projects  

- [R for FinTech: A guidebook for data science and predictive modeling](https://jasdumas.github.io/r4fintech/)
- [Tutorial on Web scraping craft brewery ratings from Beer Advocate with R and import.io](http://trendct.org/2016/03/18/tutorial-web-scraping-and-mapping-breweries-with-import-io-and-r/)
- [Shiny app for gene expression analysis for bioinformaticians](http://gdancik.github.io/shinyGEO/)

    - Lead Data Scientist for the Onboarding product team: responsible for technical mentorship, data product strategy, external data integration with APIs and experimentation design and analysis (A/B Testing)
    - Developed an early detection predictive model to monitor spikes in ACH returns leading to informed decision-making for fraudulent activity partnered with risk intervention.
    - Developed a rapid prototype using `r-shiny` and `flexdashboard` for performing power analysis

- **Associate Data Scientist at The Hartford Financial Services**, (April 2016 - Oct. 2016)
- **Data Science Intern at The Hartford Financial Services**, (Nov. 2015 - March 2016)
    - Research & Implementation of **machine learning techniques** in **variable reduction and selection** to develop predictive models for auto insurance that improve loss ratio estimates, drive strategic pricing changes and insights on competitive position.
    - Enhancing the team's data science architecture by developing and maintaining an internal **R** package, writing technical documentation and tutorials.

- **Bioinformatics Internship at the University of Connecticut Institute for Systems Genomics (UCONN)**, (Sept. 2015 - January 2016)
    - Computational and command line programming to develop a gene database for the annotation of the douglas-fir & walnut genome.

- **Student Developer at Google Summer of Code**, (May 2015 - Aug. 2015)
    - Developed a web application with R & Shiny to automate differential expression and survival analysis of micro-array gene expression datasets from the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus
