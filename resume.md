### Data Science Work Experience

 - **Data Scientist 2 at Simple Finance**, (Oct. 2016 - Present)
    - Lead Data Scientist for the Onboarding product team: responsible for technical mentorship, data product strategy, external data integration with APIs and experimentation design and analysis (A/B Testing)
    - Developed an early detection predictive model using **feature selection with Gradient Boosted Models** to monitor spikes in ACH returns leading to data-informed decisions for mitigating fraud loss partnered with the risk team
    - Developed a rapid prototype using `r-shiny` and `flexdashboard` for performing power analysis
    - Modeled causal impact with Bayesian structural **time series techniques** for fraud prevention and product feature launches

- **Associate Data Scientist at The Hartford Financial Services**, (April 2016 - Oct. 2016)
- **Data Science Intern at The Hartford Financial Services**, (Nov. 2015 - March 2016)
    - Research & Implementation of machine learning techniques in **variable reduction and selection** to develop predictive models for auto insurance that improve loss ratio estimates, drive strategic pricing changes and insights on competitive position.
    - Enhancing the team's data science architecture by developing and maintaining an internal **R** package, writing technical documentation and tutorials.

- **Bioinformatics Internship at the University of Connecticut Institute for Systems Genomics (UConn)**, (Sept. 2015 - January 2016)
    - Computational and command line programming to develop a gene database for the annotation of the douglas-fir & walnut genome.

- **Student Developer at Google Summer of Code**, (May 2015 - Aug. 2015)
    - Developed a web application with `r-shiny` to automate differential expression and survival analysis of micro-array gene expression datasets from the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus
